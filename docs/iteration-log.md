# Iteration Log

## 2026-09-19 - Seed Frame

### Objective

Record the first version of Re-Opt: a framework for optimizing multi-agent task
delegation under token, time, dependency, and quality constraints.

### Initial Design

The first version models a task as a directed graph and treats role assignment,
execution order, budget allocation, and verification as scheduler decisions.

### Working Hypothesis

For large ambiguous tasks, a role pipeline with Orchestrator, Decomposer,
Researcher, Builder, Critic, Verifier, Synthesizer, and Memory Curator should
produce better quality per run than a single linear agent flow.

### Expected Weakness

The first version is conceptual. It does not yet include:

- a scoring function calibrated by data
- executable scheduler code
- benchmark tasks
- SEA feedback records tied to repeated independent outcomes
- comparisons against simple baselines

### Next Refinement

Create a small benchmark suite with task types such as coding, research,
writing, debugging, and planning. For each task, compare:

- single-agent baseline
- critical-path scheduler
- A*-style heuristic scheduler
- breadth-first discovery followed by parallel execution

Track quality, time, token use, number of corrections, and user satisfaction.
